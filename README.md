# Celcius--Farenheight
Here is a journal reflection based on the provided files:

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
The project involved converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit to ensure accurate and consistent temperature data for multiple cities.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I implemented accurate conversion functions that ensured the data integrity across different temperature scales.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
Enhancing the input validation and error handling would make the code more robust and secure against invalid data entries.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
The most challenging part was managing floating-point precision for conversions, which I overcame by using precise mathematical functions and referencing online C++ documentation.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?**
Skills in handling file I/O operations, data validation, and implementing mathematical conversions are transferable to many other projects.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I ensured the program's maintainability by using clear variable names, adding comments, and structuring the code into functions for readability and adaptability.
